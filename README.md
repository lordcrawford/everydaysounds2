# Everyday Sounds

This web-based digital audio workstation was initially developed as a class project in 2022. Every day you go outside, you naturally create your own soundscape or 'world of sounds'; whether that's from birds chirping on your walk or Adele playing from the cars outside. I thought it'd be interesting if we could capture those sounds and make new music out of it ~ Everyday Sounds.
