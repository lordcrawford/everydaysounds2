# Everyday Sounds

Everyday Sounds is a web-based digital audio workstation originally developed as a class project in 2022. Each day, we naturally move through personal soundscapes—birds chirping during a walk, music drifting from passing cars, fragments of city life layered together. This project explores how those everyday sounds can be captured and transformed into new musical compositions.

This is a 16-step beat sequencer: a tool that allows users to program rhythms by arranging sounds over time. Each row of the sequencer corresponds to an uploaded audio sample, while each column in the drum rack represents an individual step in the sequence.

Each step will play a combination of sounds depending on which sounds are uploaded in the rows (tracks). Once one step has played for 200 milliseconds (starter tempo), it will continue to the next step, creating a continuous 16-step loop.
